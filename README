sil
===

Guys, there is not much to see here. I always wanted do develop a web server.
So this is me developing a web server. I have no agenda, draft, or blueprint. 
It is just a fun spare time project.

Running sil
-----------

Start sil, serve current directory and listen to port 8080
`java -jar sil.jar`


Note to self:
tcpdump -c 20 -s 0 -i eth1 -A host 192.168.1.1 and tcp port http
